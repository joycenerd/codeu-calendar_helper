This is a team project building by 3 young girls during CodeU program held by Google. Are you the person who likes to be organized and productive every single day? Did you find yourself using numerous to-do list/ calendar apps for different purposes and sometimes find yourself a bit trouble switching between these apps? Then give Calendar Helper a try. Calendar Helper is an all in one platform for to-do list and calendar. The highlight of Calendar Helper is we have added tagging system to the calendar events/tasks. Tags categorize your events and tasks. Another great feature of Calendar is our dashboard design. Our dashboard is good for visualizing all your tasks.
