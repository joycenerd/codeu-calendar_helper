    Summer is always a wonderful and fantastic season to me.
    During the long summer break, I am able to do a lot of things
    such as attending extracurricular activities, taking trips, learning new skills, enjoying ice cream, and so on.

    I am looking forward to learning more things, making more friends and having more funs.
