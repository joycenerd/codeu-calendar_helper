      <p>Hello, my name is Joyce Chin. I'm from Taiwan. Currently, I'm a second year computer science student in National Chung Cheng University.
        Besides CS I enjoy singing. I was a soprano and now I'm contralto. My another interest is running. I had participated in 3 half marathons
        already. My favorite TV show is Grey's Anatomy which is one of Shonda Rhimes work. I hava watched every episode from the first season in 2005 to the
        latest season season 15. My favorite character is Cristina Yang. She wants to be extaodinary and she will be extraodinary. I have learned so much 
        from Cristina Yang. I want to become Cristina Yang in CS one day.</p>
